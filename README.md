## 🎯 Mission
When a child is taken across international borders, the left-behind parent enters a chaotic world of conflicting laws (Hague Convention), law enforcement gaps, and emotional trauma.

**Recovery Hub** replaces scattered notebooks and panic with a centralized, intelligent dashboard. It helps parents:
1.  **Organize** their legal strategy.
2.  **Document** evidence securely.
3.  **Communicate** effectively with authorities using AI-assisted drafting.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Crisis Management
*   **Intelligence Dossier:** AI analyzes the specific country pair (e.g., USA -> Japan) to determine Hague Convention compliance and risk factors.
*   **Universal Task List:** Auto-generates a priority checklist based on the specific legal situation (Custody Order vs. No Order).
*   **Live Strategy Guide:** A real-time, voice-activated AI companion (using Gemini Live API) to help ground parents and plan next steps during high-stress moments.
*   **Strategy Brainstormer:** A chat interface to discuss concerns and instantly generate actionable tasks.

### 📂 Evidence & Logistics
*   **Digital Vault:** Secure, local-first document storage. AI scans PDFs/Images to extract dates and summaries automatically.
*   **Unified Timeline:** A merged view of your legal journal, phone logs, and uploaded documents sorted chronologically.
*   **Expense Tracker:** Logs travel and legal costs for future restitution claims.

### 📢 Outreach
*   **Comms HQ:** AI email drafter that injects case numbers, context, and specific tone (Firm/Urgent) into correspondence.
*   **Campaign Builder:** Instantly generates and hosts a public SEO-optimized "Bring [Child] Home" website to share with media and law enforcement.
